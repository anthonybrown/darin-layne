# Darin Layne

A child theme I developed for Darin Layne.    
I used the Avada theme and created a child theme from that.    
Nothing too exciting going here, it's what the client wanted.    

I trainned the client on how to update the site and it looks like
he changed a few things around to his liking. The site had a lot more   
custom animations and other things.
